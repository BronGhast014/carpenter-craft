# Carpenter Craft:

This is my take of what furniture would look like if it was added to Minecraft! I aimed to add furniture that still feels like part of the game and not a mod. Carpenter Craft adds 14 pieces of furniture many of which have up to 9 variants

You can get the items with the following command: /function _give:carpenter_craft/'item you want'

You can find the crafting recipes [Here](https://bronghast014.weebly.com/carpenter-craft.html)
